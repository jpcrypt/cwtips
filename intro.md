# ChipWhisperer Tips and Tricks

This book is a collection of ChipWhisperer tips, tricks, and answers to
common questions. They are mostly things that are not explicitly covered in
our [Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/newaetech/chipwhisperer-jupyter); 
things you could learn through careful study of the 
[ChipWhisperer API](https://chipwhisperer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/scope-api.html), 
but presented here in a way that is easier to digest (and with a very handy
search field!).

Consider it a "greatest hits" of questions we've seen frequently asked on our
[forum](https://forum.newae.com) -- which is where you should head if you
don't find your question answered in these pages.

We've also included some advanced usage tips for things you may not know
that ChipWhisperer can do. Hopefully you find something useful!

Unless noted otherwise, the notebooks here run the
[simpleserial-trace](https://github.com/newaetech/chipwhisperer/blob/develop/firmware/mcu/simpleserial-trace/simpleserial-trace-CW308_SAM4S.hex)
firmware on our SAM4S target with CW-Husky. Many of the things taught here are
applicable to different setups, but if you want things to run exactly as they
did for us to generate this site, that's what we used.
